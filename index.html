    <h1 class="title">In The Land Of Never, Neverland</h1>
    <i> CYBER MUSE</i>
    <p <time datetime="2025-06-10">June 10, 2025</time></p>
    <p> At first it all confused me, this life</p>
    <p> that so often feels daunting and then</p>
    <p> feels like nothing at all</p>
    <p> I wondered for many years if there was a meaning</p>
    <p> Something that defined this feeling, this nothingness </p>
    <p> But maybe that was the wrong way to look at things</p>
    <p> It can feel like when you never get what you want</p>
    <p> That the world is against you somehow</p>
    <p> But the world has other people to torment</p>
    <p> It isn't merely <a href="https://film-grab.com/wp-content/uploads/photo-gallery/imported_from_media_libray/neondemon032.jpg?bwg=1546975043">you</a></p>

    <h1 class="title">Little Did I Know</h1>\
    <i> CYBER MUSE</i>
    <p <time datetime="2025-06-04">June 6, 2025</time></p>
    <p> I thought it was the beginning of the end</p>
    <p> So I prepared with as much gusto as I could muster</p>
    <p> I counted every star, and held every hope</p>
    <p> Wondering that this is was going to be my death</p>
    <p> That when this simmer in my chest</p>
    <p> Would reach its completion</p>
    <p> That it would have been you and me</p>
    <p> Watching the world end</p>

    <h1 class="title">Paradise Feels Like Home</h1>
    <i> CYBER MUSE</i>
    <p <time datetime="2025-06-04">June 4, 2025</time></p>
    <p> When I am alone</p>
    <p> That's when I feel the safest</p>
    <p> It's the feeling of being surrounded</p>
    <p> By <a href="https://film-grab.com/wp-content/uploads/photo-gallery/Tokyo_Drifter_061.jpg?bwg=1569844285">people</a></p>
    <p> That makes me feel like the world</p>
    <p> Is swallowing me whole</p>
    <p> So paradise really</p>
    <p> Feels like home</p>

    <h1 class="title">This Is Very Hard For Me</h1>
    <i> CYBER MUSE</i>
    <p <time datetime="2025-06-03">June 3, 2025</time></p>
    <p> Honestly, all of this is really infuriating for me</p>
    <p> The process of living and having to do things</p>
    <p> Makes my heart feel really empty</p>

    <h1 class="title">I Forget Who I Am All The Time</h1>
    <i> CYBER MUSE</i>
    <p <time datetime="2025-06-03">June 3, 2025</time></p>
    <p> There are times I forget</p>
    <p> And it isn't the soft fading away kind</p>
    <p> It's when I wake up and my mind becomes barren</p>
    <p> I don't know who I am or what I should be</p>
    <p> I try and cling onto anything that could hold water</p>
    <p> But everything dissipates before my hands could reach</p>
    <p> And I am trapped in the middle of everything</p>
    <p> Wondering if any part of me is actually <a href = "https://film-grab.com/wp-content/uploads/photo-gallery/33%20(371).jpg?bwg=1547215973">real</a></p>

    <h1 class="title">The State of Emptiness</h1>
    <i> CYBER MUSE</i>
    <p <time datetime="2025-06-02">June 2, 2025</time></p>
    <p> I wanted to care a long time ago </p>
    <p> So I pushed against the tides of my tattered mind</p>
    <p> and <a href="https://film-grab.com/wp-content/uploads/photo-gallery/61%20(283).jpg?bwg=1547211923">tried</a></p>
    <p> I got what I wanted</p>
    <p> I cared so much I felt like glass being tapped on</p>
    <p> And then</p>
    <p> Silence </p>

    <h1 class="title">Do You Find Our Hope Meaningless?</h1>
    <i>CYBER MUSE</i>
    <p <time datetime="2025-06-02">June 2, 2025</time></p>
    <p> The radiance that comes with believing is something that can't be easily explained</p>
    <p> You have so much wonder and hope for the world that you keep trying, you keep wanting more</p>
    <p> But the world rejects you and calls you <a href="https://film-grab.com/wp-content/uploads/photo-gallery/bladerunner063.jpg?bwg=1551282394">selfish</a> for it</p>
    <p> Maybe that's the whole point of it</p>
    <p> To be less understood</p>
    <p> To be safe</p>

    <i>CYBER MUSE</i>
    <p <time datetime="2025-06-01">June 1, 2025 </time></p>
    <p> I can feel all my dreams</p>
    <p> Converging in one place</p>
    <p> In that space of nothingness and dreams</p>
    <p> I have found a place to dream, a place to frolick</p>
    <p> So keep watching my steps, starchildren</p>
    <p> I'll find a way to come home... soon</p>
